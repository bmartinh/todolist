Todo List App in React
by Borja Martín Hernández

This project uses MongoDB and Google OAuth for authentication.
In order for it to work, you need to create a MongoDB database and then change de variable mongoURI in /config/default.json with yours.
Remember to also change the password.

You'll need to register a new app in Google OAuth and then change the client ID to yours in /client/components/GoogleAuth.js

Enjoy the app!
